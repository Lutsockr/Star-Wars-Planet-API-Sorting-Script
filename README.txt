This script is written in JavaScript with Node.js / NPM.
To run the script, I open the script with Visual Studio Code, open a terminal in the same folder, and execute the command 'node run'.
The script will output a csv file in the same directory called sortedPlanets.csv after a short console output about the data being filtered and written.
